# k6

This repository provides example scripts and instructions for **running tests** using [k6](https://k6.io/), a modern load testing tool.

The examples help you quickly understand what tests are for, how to write, execute, and analyze tests, with a focus on simplicity and practical application.

- Types of tests
    - [Smoke test](smoke-test/text.md)
    - [Load test](load-test/definition.md)

To better understand the terms in testing and k6 see [vocabulary](vocabulary.md).
