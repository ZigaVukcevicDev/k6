# Reliability and performance tests with k6 examples

Repository provides example scripts and instructions for **running tests** using [k6](https://k6.io/), a modern load testing tool.

The examples help you **quickly understand** what each test is for, how to write, execute, and analyze tests, with a focus on simplicity and practical application.
